As my home mountain for 17 seasons, I have seen it all—the annual increase in crowds/lift lines, rising ticket prices, and the removal of the local feel that I remember. Stevens offers a solid expert-only area and has some of the best night skiing in the country, but between the parking, fog, and lift lines, little is notable anymore about my once-beloved second home.",

Otherwise, the altitude is really low, meaning wet snow, rain, and consistent fog. The mountain is a wide hill that has little vertical drop, good for learning, bad for ripping. It sits right off I-90, the main highway between each side of the state, meaning you hear car noise while skiing. I personally like my mountains to have disconnect. Only come here to learn.",
